# Paragon

An application that tracks time, actions, and intentions similar to other tools you've heard of. The twist is our focus on providing a more kinesthetic, auditory, and overall human interface through things like voice recognition and virtual AI assistants while treating you like the intelligent creature you are. More than just a tool to get things done the way you already do, we believe you are capable of integrating advanced introspective techniques for process improvement, greater focus, and more effective use of time into your workflow without obstructing it. What kind of techniques?

1. Spaced repetition for retention of new knowledge, and integration with a wide array of tools you may already use to synthesize that knowledge as you encounter it.
2. Deep Work, i.e. asking yourself direct and actionable questions about how you're using your time in the mould of well known mentors, authors, and researchers who broach the subject.
3. Automatically scheduling the "biohacks" like meditation, breath work, and powernaps into your routine based on integration with fitness tracking technologies and insights into your process gleaned from time tracking and some back and forth between you and Paragon's assistant - questions such as:

| Scenario | Question |
| - | - |
| You've been browsing reddit or similar for 20m | Anything interesting on reddit (or similar) today? What were you working on before you started browsing reddit (or similar)? How are your energy levels right now? |
| You've delayed <IMPORTANT TASK A> for 2 days running | Would you like me to downgrade <IMPORTANT TASK A> and notify <CC'd PARTIES>? Can you think of someone I can delegate <IMPORTANT TASK A> to? |
| You just had a meeting with clients/coworkers | What were the most important things to note from your meeting? Is there anything you forgot to bring up in the meeting? Did you feel prepared for the meeting? If you could reclaim the time you just spent meeting with <PARTIS AT MEETING> and put it into something else, would you? What would that be? |
  
Of course the Q & A would be configurable, as would time tracking, as would your classification of what going to reddit means for you - but the goal is to trigger a much more powerful instrument for augmentation of your process and achievements, your own mind. Simply playing back what you have answere to these questions in the morning as you make coffee, or in the shower might just trigger that insight you haven't been willing to articulate and get you iterating on it. The other side of the coin is to provide a platform where you can maximize the effect and nuance of your iterative process, and bring the barrier to iteration all the way down to barking a few statements to your Google Home, Alexa, or Siri in the shower.

# When?
